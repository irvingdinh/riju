title: 'LeetCode - My take on "Longest Common Prefix"'
---

### Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
* `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Possible Solutions

This problem presents several potential solutions, each with different time and space complexity trade-offs. The approach that leverages a map for counting frequencies and an array for sorting these counts would be the most balanced in terms of both time and space complexity.

* Iterate through the array, incrementing the count of each element in a map.
* Convert the keys in the map to an array.
* Sort the keys in descending order based on their frequencies in the map.
* Finally, slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of unique elements in the array. This is because we perform a sorting operation on the array of keys.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We store each element and its count in the Map and in the sorted array.

### My Take in TypeScript

```
function topKFrequent(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const map = new Map<number, number>();
    for (const num of nums) {
        map.set(num, (map.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const sortedKeys = Array
        .from(map.keys())
        .sort((a, b) => map.get(b) - map.get(a));

    return sortedKeys.slice(0, k);
};
```

**Result:**

- Runtime: 58 ms, beats **99.67%**.
- Memory: 45.9 MB, beats **63.98%**.
