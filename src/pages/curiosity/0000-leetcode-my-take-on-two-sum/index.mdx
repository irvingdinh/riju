title: "LeetCode - My take on `Two Sum`"
---

### Description

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

### Possible Solutions

There are a number of approaches to solve this problem, each with a different time and space complexity. Here are a few
solutions from the least optimized to the most optimized:

1. **Brute Force:** This approach involves using two nested loops to iterate over the input array and find the two
numbers that sum to the target. This is the least efficient solution because it has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n
is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1).

2. **Two-Pass Hash Table:** First, we iterate through the input array, storing each element and its index in a hash
table. Then, we make a second pass through the array, and for each element, we check if the complement (target - current
element) exists in our hash table. If it does, we return the indices of the current element and its complement. This
approach improves upon the brute force method by trading space for time: it has a time complexity of O(n) and a space
complexity of O(n).

3. **Sorting and Two Pointers:** In this approach, we first sort the array, then we initialize two pointers, one at the
start of the array and the other at the end. We move the pointers inward until we find the two numbers that add up to the
target. While this approach also has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation and space complexity of
O(1), it requires modifying the input array and doesn't allow us to return the original indices of the numbers.

4. **One-Pass Hash Table:** This is the most efficient approach. As we iterate through the array, we check if each
element's complement (target - current element) already exists in our hash table. If it does, we return the indices of
the current element and its complement. If not, we insert the current element into the hash table. This approach has a
time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), like the two-pass hash table, but it only requires one pass
through the array.

In terms of both time and space complexity, the one-pass hash table approach is generally considered the most optimized
solution for this problem.

### My Solution in TypeScript

```
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const numToPos: Record<number, number> = {}

    for (let x = 0; x < nums.length; x++) {
        const num = nums[x]
        const delta = target - num

        if (numToPos[delta] != undefined) {
            return [x, numToPos[delta]]
        }

        numToPos[num] = x
    }
};
```

**Result:**

- Runtime: 74 ms, beats **62.34%**.
- Memory: 45 MB, beats **55.24%**.
