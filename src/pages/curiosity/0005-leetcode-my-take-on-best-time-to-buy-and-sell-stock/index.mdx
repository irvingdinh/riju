title: 'LeetCode - My take on "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"'
---

### Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

### Possible Solutions

The problem can be approached with a dynamic programming perspective. The idea is to traverse the price array, maintain the lowest price seen so far and compute the profit (current price - minimum price) for each day. The maximum of these profits is our answer as it represents the maximum profit that could be made by selling a stock.

### My Take in TypeScript

```
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let minPrice = prices[0]
    let maxProfit = 0

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        const price = prices[i]
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price
        } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = price - minPrice
        }
    }

    return maxProfit
}
```

**Result:**

- Runtime: 82 ms, beats **84.59%**.
- Memory: 52 MB, beats **54.52%**.
