title: 'LeetCode - My take on "Contains Duplicate"'
---

### Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value **appears at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Possible Solutions

This is a simple but interesting question, because it has a trade-off between time complexity and space complexity, as:

#### Using Hash/Set Approach

* Iterate through the array, adding each element to a hash table or set.
* If an element already exists in the hash table or set, return true because a duplicate has been found.
* If you iterate through the entire array without finding a duplicate, return false.

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we perform a single pass through the array, during which we perform a constant time operation (insertion or lookup) for each element.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. As in the worst-case scenario, all elements are distinct, and we need to store all of them in the set or hash table.

#### Sorting and Comparing Neighbors Approach

* First, sort the array. Once the array is sorted, all duplicate elements would be positioned next to each other.
* By iterating through the array once more and comparing each pair of neighboring elements, you can find if there are any duplicates.

* **Time Complexity:** The dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting operation, which is typically `O(n log n)` for most standard sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort. The subsequent pass to check for duplicates is `O(n)`, which is smaller than `O(n log n)` and hence, ignored in Big O notation. So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity depends on the sorting algorithm used. For example, heapsort has a space complexity of `O(1)`, while mergesort has a space complexity of `O(n)`. If you are using an in-place sorting algorithm like heapsort or quicksort, the space complexity would be `O(1)`. If not, it could be as much as `O(n)`.

### My Take in TypeScript

In the name of safety, I choose to go with using hash/set approach:

```
function containsDuplicate(nums: number[]): boolean {
    const existed: Record<number, boolean> = {}
    for (let x = 0; x < nums.length; x++) {
        if (existed[nums[x]] != undefined) {
            return true
        }

        existed[nums[x]] = true
    }

    return false
};
```

**Result:**

- Runtime: 101 ms, beats **46.76%**.
- Memory: 54.1 MB, beats **80.72%**.
