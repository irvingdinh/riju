### Introduction into the Internet

- Before we learn what is the Internet is, we need to understand what is "network" is?
- A network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other. E.g.
    - You at your home might have a network of computers and devices;
    - Your friend living next door might have a similar network of devices;
    - Their neighbor might have a similar network of devices;

> The internet is the network of networks.

### How does Internet work: An Overview

- At high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems using a set of standardized protocols.
- These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably & securely.
- The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems.
    - When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router.
    - The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its final destination.
    - This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.
- To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including...
    - Internet Protocol (IP) is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination.
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.
    - etc.
- In addition to these core protocols, there are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet, including...
    - Domain Name System (DNS);
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (TCP);
    - Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS);
    - etc.

### Basic Concepts & Terminology

- **Packet**: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
- **Router**: A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
- **IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to correct destination.
- **Domain Name**: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as `google.com`.
- **DNS**: The "Domain Name System" is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- **HTTP**: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website)
- **HTTPS**: The encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
- **SSL/TLS**: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.
